    "# Sherman lab RNAseq analysis pipeline\n",

    "## Why use a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to walk through the analysis of RNAseq data for a paper I'm working on. Initially this Jupyter notebook was for me alone, a way for me to keep the code and notes for this bit of analysis organized. Then realized I could share this with people in our lab, David in particular, who might get a lot of insight from reading a Jupyter style notebook. I like the way I can walk you through my notes, methods, and the resulting tables and figures all in a single narrative. You can also try making changes to the code on the fly with no coding experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I realized I might be able to make this more broadly useful to the TB field, so I'm going to try to write this so that it is comprehensible to a general audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have taken this notebook and posted it to myBinder.com so that anyone can use it without having to install _anything_ on their computer other than an internet browser. That is so cool. You can also share this notebook with anyone who has Anaconda installed on their computer, so here are additional installation steps for users running this locally (instead of just looking at the contents on nbviewer or running it from myBinder.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to to do the following steps:\n",
    "1. Install the __[Anaconda python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)__. This will let you run all of the python scripts, pre-installs the most popular Python libraries, provides Jupyter notebook support, and, like BioConductor for R, is curated to maintain stability.\n",
    "2. Install the Clustergrammer 'widget' so we can generate interactive heatmaps/dendograms.\n",
    "    - First run the 'Anaconda prompt' to open a window where we can install new libraries\n",
    "    - Then run the following commands:\n",
    "        -  conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets\n",
    "        -  pip install --upgrade clustergrammer_widget\n",
    "        -  jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension\n",
    "        -  jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix clustergrammer_widget\n",
    "3. The big one. This notebook is designed to be used with __[tidy datasets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)__. That means each row is a different observation, in this case an RNAseq run, and each column is a different variable, here either the expression for a given gene or a column of metadata. \n",
    "\n",
    " ***\n",
    "This version of the notebook is focused on presenting the data from a specific experiment. \n",
    "I think I can make this more generally useful, a really Plug-n-Play RNAseq analysis pipeline that\n",
    "can take any log-normal distributed type of data and get a good first pass understanding of what the data tells you.\n",
    "Making that more generic tool will take more time, but if I seem to being doing things in a round-about fashion, \n",
    "that may be why.\n",
    " \n",
    "I'm going to assume you know how to use Jupyter notebooks. If not, there are many good [basic intros to Jupyter notebooks](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=github+getting+started) on YouTube. \n",
    "***\n",
    "This notebook was inspired by the excellent walkthrough of Seaborn plotting __[here](https://www.kaggle.com/mjbahmani/a-comprehensive-ml-workflow-with-python)__ and the __[Zika virus notebook](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4972086/)__ from the Ma'ayan lab, and when possible I simply borrowed code from those examples.

    "## Experimental design\n",
    "\n",
    "These data come from an experiment testing the transcriptional impact of perturbing specific transcription factors of _Mycobacerium tuberculosis_ (Mtb), specifically in the context of a hypoxic time course. Oxygen limitation is an environmental stress that arrests growth, alters the drug susceptibility profile, and leads to a complex remodeling of the transcriptome that changes the expression of the majority of the Mtb genes. Hypoxia, or oxygen limitation, is a common in vitro model of Mtb in the latent phase of infection. \n",
    "\n",
    "A prior screen of all of the Mtb transcription factors (TFs) by us identified six TFs that were impaired in their ability to return to active growth when oxygen is returned after 7 days of hypoxia. We have dubbed this set of TFs the Critical Oxygen Response Regulators, or CORRs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset variables\n",
    "\n",
    " - Strains: Each strain is carrying the same TF overexpression plasmid with the only difference being the insert\n",
    "    - Rv0023  - a previously undescribed TF that triggers many of the expression changes triggered by hypoxia when induced\n",
    "    -  Rv0081  - part of the initial hypoxic response, regulon also has large overlap with hypoxic response\n",
    "    -  Rv0353  - HspR, regulator of the heat shock protein chaperones\n",
    "    -  Rv1985c - Several proposed functions for this TF, none confirmed yet, deleted in the vaccine strain BCG\n",
    "    -  Rv2788  - SirR, suggested role as regulator of manganese homeostasis and other stress responses\n",
    "    -  Rv3416  - WhiB3, redox homeostasis regulator, described in multiple papers from Adrie Steyn\n",
    "    -  Empty   - This strain carrys the same plasmid as the others, but there is no TF inserted\n",
    "\n",
    " - Hypoxia: Each strain was taken through a hypoxic time course that begins with log phase growth to hypoxia and reaeration\n",
    "    -  Log\n",
    "    -  Hypoxia\n",
    "    -  Reaeration\n",
    "\n",
    " - Time: After the day 0 sample is taken the culuture is transfered to a flask that has a steady flow of nitrogen with 0.2% oxygen, roughly 1% of atmospheric.\n",
    "    -  Day 0  - Log phase culture\n",
    "    -  Day 2  - Hypoxia\n",
    "    -  Day 4  - Hypoxia\n",
    "    -  Day 7  - Hypoxia. Culture transfered to aerobic rolling flask\n",
    "    -  Day 8  - Reaeration\n",
    "    -  Day 9  - Reaeration\n",
    "    -  Day 10 - Reaeration\n",
    "    -  Day 11 - Reaeration\n",
    "    -  Day 12 - Reaeration. Not present for some strains\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More detail for people with less background in TB research and our prior experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The strains used in this experiment were made as part of a previous project. They all come from the lab strain H37Rv, often abbreviated 'Rv', and each strain is carrying a plasmid that allows us to induce the overexpression of one of the CORRs. These plasmids have the TF gene downstream of a strong promoter and the TetO operator, which is recognized by the TetR repressor. In the presence of the inducer (anhydrotetracycline or Atc) TetR is removed from the promoter and these strains begin expressing that TF from the plasmid in addition to the native copy in the genome. These TFs have varying levels of baseline expression, but in all cases the given TF becomes one of the most highly expressed genes in the genome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that these TFs have been modified so that they carry a FLAG tag on their C' tail. We don't haven't found an example where the tail has any impact on the TF function, but it is certainly possible that in some cases that extra bit will interfere or modify DNA binding properties. Note- the FLAG tag was used in ChIP experiments to determine the DNA binding profile of each TF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transcription factors typically change their promoter affinity based on some secondary signal like a small molecule, modifications to the TF by another protein (e.g. phosphorylation by a kinase), or interaction with a partner protein. In this case however we are driving activation of these TFs by mass action, simply overcoming the weak interaction of the TF without the activating signal by generating an excess of TF, some of which will bind to and activate that gene's regulon. \n",
    "\n",
    "Activation of TFs by overexpression could lead to binding and activation of genes not normally regulated by that TF. It's also possible that the the TF may have some impact on the cell other than DNA binding, and these effects could lead to changes in gene expression. "

    "Generally, the replicates look like each other, the log phase looks like reaeration, and the hypoxic timepoints look like each other. There are other interesting patterns here. Look at the plot for the strain overexpressing Rv3416, just above. Notice the banding pattern in the reaeration samples. It looks like one of the replicates (R2) has reaeration expression profiles that look more like hypoxia than the other replicates. We could eliminate that sample as an outlier, but for now I will leave it there and just keep that variation in mind when interpreting the data below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's collapse the replicates, and then convert to log base 2. Why do I do this? Expression data has a log-normal distribution, so it's simpler to plot and understand the data in a log scale. There is nothing magical about a two-fold difference of course, but in my experience even under the best of conditions with minimal noise changes less than two fold are rarely significant. So, having log base 2 means that we can easily see two fold steps in expression."
