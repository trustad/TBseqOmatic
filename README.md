I would like to do three things with this project. First and foremost I need to organize the analysis and track the methods I'm using while I work on a paper on transcriptional control of the TB hypoxic response. I'm  finding that this approach is letting me set up routines for analyzing this type of data, routines I've re-created from close to scratch all too often.

I'm also begining to think that this is a very good way for me to share this data and solicit feedback from other luminaries of the Sherman lab, maybe even as a way to share the data with the general public if I include a link to this repository in the paper. There's something very approachable about Jupyter notebooks that I think will work very well for me.

Finally I have some hope that what I'm making here could be a more generally useful tool for the TB field, particularly if I can automate and simplify the alignment and analysis of significance steps. However for now I'm going to completely skip these steps as they are going to be time consuming and I'd rather have a functional prototype without those functions as soon as possible. 

You can also access a cloud based implementation of this notebook at MyBinder.org that you can run and change on the fly without installing a single bit of software on the local computer other than an internet browser. This is still a work in progress, but for now feel free to go check it out: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/trustad/TBseqOmatic/master?filepath=RNAseq%20analysis%20worksheet.ipynb)

I'd like to get this working with Google colaboratory as well, but I still need to figure out the best way to host and share the data in that environment.
